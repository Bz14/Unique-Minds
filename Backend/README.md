# Loan Tracker API

## Overview

This Loan Tracker API is a backend project developed using Golang with the Gin framework. The API provides functionalities for both users and admins, allowing users to apply for loans and manage their accounts, while admins can manage user accounts and loan details. The project is built following clean architecture principles to ensure a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

1. Develop a RESTful API using Golang and the Gin framework.
2. Implement user and admin functionalities.
3. Apply clean architecture principles.
4. Ensure secure and efficient handling of data.
5. Document the API using Postman.

## Project Structure

The project follows the clean architecture principles, separating the codebase into different layers such as `domain`, `usecase`, `repository`, and `delivery`. This structure ensures that the business logic is decoupled from external frameworks, making the code more maintainable and testable.

## Functional Requirements

### User Management

1.  **User Registration**

    - Endpoint: POST /users/register
    - Description: Register a new user with email, password, and profile details.
    - Response: Success or error message.

2.  **Email Verification**

    - Endpoint: GET /users/verify-email
    - Description: Verify the user's email address using a token sent to their email.

## Endpoints

### User Management Endpoints

- **POST** /users/register: Register a new user.
- **GET** /users/verify-email: Verify user's email.
- **POST** /users/login: Login a user.
- **POST** /users/token/refresh: Refresh access token.
- **GET** /users/profile: Retrieve user profile.
- **POST** /users/password-reset: Request password reset.
- **POST** /users/password-update: Update password after reset.

### Admin Functionalities Endpoints

- **GET** /admin/users: Retrieve all users.
- **DELETE** /admin/users/{id}: Delete a user account.

## Authentication and Authorization

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authenticating and authorizing users. Access tokens and refresh tokens are used to secure endpoints and manage user sessions.

- **Access Token**: Short-lived token used to access protected resources.
- **Refresh Token**: Long-lived token used to obtain a new access token.

## Postman Documentation

A Postman collection has been provided for testing the API endpoints. You can import the collection into Postman and use it to interact with the API.
